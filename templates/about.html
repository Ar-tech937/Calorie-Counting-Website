            “What is a healthy diet?” Many clinicians find themselves at a loss to answer this common question from patients. The difficulty of offering a simple answer is understandable. The overwhelming volume of data generated by food and nutrition researchers coupled with sometimes contradictory findings, the seeming flip-flops in recommendations, and the flood of misinformation in diet books and the media can make it seem as though explaining the essentials of healthy eating is akin to describing the intricacies of particle physics. That is unfortunate, because there are now enough solid strands of evidence from reliable sources to weave simple but compelling recommendations about diet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diet, of course, is just one approach to preventing illness. Limiting caloric intake to maintain a healthy weight and exercising regularly are two essential strategies. And we aim to address the first.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are three reasons why calorie counting likely works:
            <ul>
              <li>Tracking your calories can help you identify which eating patterns you need to be mindful to successfully lose weight.</li>
              <li>Despite its lack of precision, being aware through tracking of what you eat can give you an approximate baseline to work from and compare with when you’re trying to reduce the total number of calories you eat per day.</li>
              <li>Finally, keeping track of what you eat can help you monitor your behavior. This may help keep you accountable for the daily choices you make and motivate you to continue progressing toward your goals.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            When talking about calories, it’s important to make the distinction between quantity and quality. Even foods that have the same quantity of calories can be of different nutritional quality and can have very different effects on your health. Furthermore, nutrient-dense foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables are linked to a lower risk of mortality.
            In addition to their differing impact on health outcomes, different foods tend to affect your metabolism, hormone levels, hunger, and appetite differently.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, eating 100 calories worth of donuts may not diminish your hunger as effectively as eating 100 calories from apples due to the relative amounts of refined carbs, sugar, and fiber in the donuts.
            Therefore, a donut may make you more likely to overeat later in the day, preventing you from achieving the calorie deficit needed for weight loss.
